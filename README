method to simply an quickly post expand a cmd.  "index ff<c-cr>" for example.
(<c-cr> being mapped to this cmd.)

NOTE this is a QUICKY!
For what it is worth, hopefully useful to someone :)

The reason for this over a basic mapping, or DrC.Stubs is the ability to
specify the variable(s) to work on.

I.e.
  iInd < m_array.size() for<c-cr>

  for    (    iInd = 0; iInd < m_array.size(); iInd++)
  {
      <cursor>
  }

or
  m_array ff<c-cr>

  for(int i=0;i<m_array.length; i++){
      <cursor>
  }//end for loop over array m_array[i]

NOTE that the command function shold leave the cursor in a position that a
normal mode `o` will place the cursor at the desired location. Kind of a HACK
but good enough for now.
